# Basic Arithmetic Skills | Snake Game Edition

## Description
This project, developed by the SCS 1201 A students of FEU Alabang, integrates the classic Snake Game with an educational twist to support a practical research study on mental arithmetic skills. The game aims to assess and reinforce basic arithmetic skills by engaging players in a dynamic learning experience.

In this game, players control a snake that eats integer numbers, each containing a simple arithmetic problem. Players must quickly solve each problem to gain points and extend the length of the snake. The objective is to gauge the player's ability to perform basic mental arithmetic skills, adding a challenging element that highlights both proficiency and areas for improvement.

Our primary research goal is to study the difference in performance between players with strong basic arithmetic skills and those with lower proficiency in mental arithmetic. By analyzing game results, we aim to gain insights into how real-time gameplay can serve as an effective tool for reinforcing and testing mental math skills.
